# New Relic Swift Package Manager Deployment

New Relic's mobile monitoring capabilities help you gain deeper visibility into how to analyze your iOS application performance and troubleshoot crashes. You can also examine HTTP and other network performance for unexpected lag, which will in turn help you collaborate more efficiently with your backend teams.

## Release Notes
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/xcframework-release-notes/

## Installation
1. Select **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...**.
2. Add the Github URL of the Package file:
  
  ```
  https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ios-agent-spm
  ```
  
>If you receive an `artifact of binary target 'NewRelic' failed extraction: The operation couldn’t be completed. (TSCBasic.StringError error 1.)` error when extracting the package, please close Xcode, delete the Derrived Data folder, re-open Xcode, and try again.
  
3. Select the NewRelic package product, select your target, and select Finish.
4. In your `AppDelegate.swift` file, add this call as the first line of `applicationDidFinishLaunchWithOptions`, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/maintenance/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:"APP_TOKEN")
   ```
   To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()`, and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.

5. Add a build script to your target's **Build Phases**. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following snippet, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/maintenance/viewing-your-application-token):
 - Depending on your agent version add the code block below.
    - Use this line as your run script on **iOS Agent 7.4.0+**:
   ```sh
   ARTIFACT_DIR="${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}SourcePackages/artifacts"
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -type f -name run-symbol-tool | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
    - For **iOS Agent 7.3.8** or before you must use the following 6 line script:
    ```sh
    SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`

    if [ -z "${SCRIPT}"]; then
    ARTIFACT_DIR="${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}SourcePackages/artifacts"
    SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
    fi

    /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```

- Optional Step: Add the following lines to your build script above the existing lines to skip symbol upload during debugging.
    ```sh
    if [ ${CONFIGURATION} = "Debug" ]; then
        echo "Skipping DSYM upload CONFIGURATION: ${CONFIGURATION}"
        exit 0
    fi
    ```

6. If there is a checkbox below Run script that says "Run script: Based on Dependency analysis" please make sure it is not checked.

7. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device.


## Getting Started
If you have not created a Mobile Application:

* Click "Add more" in the top right,
* name your application, and
* download the New Relic agent for your platform and follow the instructions.
* You can also select the “Add more data” option from the user menu in the upper right corner of the top navigation, then the iOS button to access the installation page.

If you have previously created a Mobile Application:

* Click the name of your mobile app,
* choose Installation from the Settings section in the left nav, and
* download the New Relic agent for your platform and follow the instructions.

## Troubleshooting
You might see the following errors when adding the Swift package:
- Artifact does not match checksum
- Cannot download framework from remoteSourceControl

If you see these types of errors, try the following:

1. De-integrate New Relic Swift package from the Xcode project.
2. Run these commands from the terminal to delete spm caches:
    ```
    rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm
    rm -rf ~/Library/org.swift.swiftpm
    ```
3. Delete derived data using Xcode.
4. Re-integrate the New Relic Swift package into the Xcode project.
